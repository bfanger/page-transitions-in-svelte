The talk given by [Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/) for GoogleIO:
[Bringing page transitions to the web (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCJUPJ_zDQ4)

[Demo (original)](https://http203-playlist.netlify.app/) - [source](https://github.com/jakearchibald/http203-playlist)

This inspired me to recreate these animations using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
